Hi [PM’s Name],

Just keeping you updated on the ACA migration. I’m currently leading GitHub pipelines and containerization and am committed to learning and helping. However, given the limited time and my current familiarity with the app side, especially since I’m rebuilding from source with little app team input, I believe it would be more effective for me to support the team rather than lead this effort.

Some details around app scope and deadline expectations are still unclear to me. Any clarity you can provide would help me stay aligned and contribute effectively.

Thanks,

Hi [Architect’s Name],

Thanks for walking us through the app re-engineering—it’s clearly complex. I’m confident handling the automation side like environment files and GitHub imports, but I’m still building the skills needed for the app re-engineering itself, especially given the tight timeline.

Since there’s no one more experienced available, I’ll need support or more time to handle that part well. I’m eager to learn and contribute—appreciate any guidance as I ramp up.

Thanks,

Subject: ACA Migration Role and Timeline Clarification

Hi [Manager],

Thanks for involving me in the ACA migration effort. I’m eager to contribute fully and bring my strengths in automation, scripting, and managing GitHub pipelines—including environment file creation and secret management.

That said, given the tight deadline and that I was brought in at a very late stage and assigned the lead role, I’m concerned about the risks this creates, especially since there’s limited time to onboard and collaborate closely with the app teams for the detailed app knowledge needed.

While I’m confident handling the automation side, rebuilding the apps from source without significant app team involvement is an area where I’m still developing skills. Leading this effort under these conditions could impact the migration timeline and success.

I’d appreciate if we could clarify roles and expectations to align on how to best leverage my strengths and support the team effectively.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
