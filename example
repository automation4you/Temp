Hi [PM’s Name],

Just keeping you updated on the ACA migration. I’m currently leading GitHub pipelines and containerization and am committed to learning and helping. However, given the limited time and my current familiarity with the app side, especially since I’m rebuilding from source with little app team input, I believe it would be more effective for me to support the team rather than lead this effort.

Some details around app scope and deadline expectations are still unclear to me. Any clarity you can provide would help me stay aligned and contribute effectively.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
