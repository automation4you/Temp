ðŸ“Œ Desired Goal:
Automate repetitive administrative tasks that occur after system deployments to improve efficiency, reduce human error, and ensure standardized post-deployment operations.

ðŸ”§ Specific Actions (How Will It Be Achieved):
Utilize a centralized GitHub Actions master workflow to orchestrate a series of sub-actions. Each sub-action will run targeted PowerShell scripts on GitHub self-hosted runners to execute specific post-deployment tasks such as domain join, OU placement, configuration enforcement, and application installs. This ensures consistency across environments and minimizes manual intervention.

ðŸ“ˆ Measure of Success:

90%+ reduction in manual administrative effort per deployment

Post-deployment tasks completed in <5 minutes (previously 30+ mins)

Zero critical errors or omissions in automated post-deployment steps over 30 consecutive deployments

Positive feedback from DevOps/Infrastructure team in quarterly workflow satisfaction survey
